  <h1>Letter to My Tutor</h1>
  <h2>Dear Mr. Dele,</h2>

  <p class="indent">
    I hope you are doing well. I want to say thank you for teaching me front end
    web development. I am learning how to use HTML and CSS, and I enjoy it a lot.
  </p>

  <p class="indent">
    Your lessons have made a big difference in my learning. I find it intriguing
    how web pages are built, and now I can clearly see how HTML gives the structure
    while CSS makes everything look beautiful. I enjoy practicing what you teach
    after each class, and it makes me more confident in my skills. I also like that
    you explain things in a simple way, which helps me stay motivated and interested
    in web development.
  </p>

  <p class="indent">
    Thank you for your guidance and support.
  </p>

  <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
